Hi Everyone!

Today we're going to create a new web application with JavaScript .

In this tutorial, a JavaScript Beginner can create a functional Weather App with ease. and won't face any problems doing that.

The only difficulty you might face, is how to work with an API using JavaScript? but trust me that won't be of a big problem.

The API provider is http://www.OpenWeatherMap.org
